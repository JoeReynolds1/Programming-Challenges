# Scheme challenges

All files ending in `.ss` or `.scm` use Chicken Scheme. The rest are done in Racket.

I use Chicken Scheme and the egg `test`. You'll need these two to run these programs:

```
sudo apt-get install chicken-bin libchicken-dev libchicken6
sudo chicken-install test
```

To run these you will need it installed. Once installed you can run the challenge files like so

`csi -s 245.ss`

You can omit the `-s` but then you'll be dropped into an interactive scheme session, which you probably don't want
