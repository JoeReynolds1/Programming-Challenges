def say_hello(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print("hello")
    say_hello(n-1)


Explanation - We define a function that takes a number N. N is the amount of times you want to print "Hello".
Once defined, we make sure that N is greater than 0, if it's not we return and do nothing. If it is greater than 0
we continue with the rest of the code.

We print hello and then call say_hello(n-1) in our function.
